  <design_movement>Neumorphism / Soft UI</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Trust & Softness**: Use soft shadows and rounded shapes to create a sense of calm and safety, essential for debt-stressed users.
    2. **Clarity through Depth**: Use subtle extrusion and indentation to guide users to important actions (like "Find a Counsellor") without overwhelming them.
    3. **Minimalist Information Architecture**: Present complex legal info in bite-sized, easily digestible "cards" that feel tactile.
    4. **Accessibility First**: High contrast text on soft backgrounds to ensure readability for all demographics.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Calm Stability"**: A palette dominated by off-whites, soft grays, and a reassuring, deep ocean blue. The goal is to lower the user's blood pressure. Debt and law are stressful; the site should be the antidote.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Card-Based Masonry**: Instead of a rigid grid, use a fluid masonry layout of soft cards for news and FAQs. This feels more organic and less "corporate/bureaucratic."
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Soft-Shadow Buttons**: Buttons that look like they are physically pressed into the screen.
    2. **Frosted Glass Overlays**: For modal dialogs or sticky headers, adding a touch of modern elegance.
    3. **Circular Progress Indicators**: Visualizing "Debt Free" journeys or stats in a friendly, non-threatening way.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Tactile Feedback**: Hover states should feel like the surface is shifting. Clicks should feel responsive and substantial.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Gentle Floating**: Elements shouldn't fly in; they should gently float up or fade in. No harsh movements.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Nunito (Rounded Sans) + Roboto**: Nunito for headings to appear friendly and approachable; Roboto for body text to maintain strict legibility and professionalism.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Swiss Style / International Typographic Style</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Objective Clarity**: The law is black and white (mostly). The design should reflect absolute clarity and objectivity.
    2. **Grid Precision**: A visible or highly structured grid system that organizes information logically.
    3. **Asymmetry**: Use asymmetrical layouts to create dynamic tension and interest without clutter.
    4. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold typography used not just for reading but as the primary visual element.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Regulatory Authority"**: Stark white background, jet black text, and a single, bold signal color like "Alert Red" or "Safety Orange" used *very* sparingly for key actions. This conveys urgency and importance.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Modular Grid**: A strict multi-column grid where text blocks and images align perfectly. Content is king; decoration is zero.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Thick Horizontal Rules**: Heavy black lines separating sections, reminiscent of legal documents or newspapers.
    2. **Oversized Section Numbers**: "01", "02" in massive font size to guide the user through the "Act".
    3. **Monochrome Photography**: High-contrast black and white photos of South African life/people.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Instant & Sharp**: No fades. Hover effects are instant color swaps (Black to Red). It feels efficient and precise.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Slide & Reveal**: Content slides in from behind masks. Sharp, linear easing.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Helvetica Now (or Inter) + IBM Plex Mono**: Helvetica for that classic Swiss look (neutral, authoritative). Mono font for data, dates, and legal references.
  </typography_system>

<idea>
  <design_movement>Modern African Corporate / Afro-Futurism Lite</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Local Identity**: Subtly incorporating South African geometric patterns or colors without being kitschy.
    2. **Human-Centric**: Focus on faces and people. The Act is about *people*, not just money.
    3. **Vibrant Professionalism**: Moving away from "boring bank blue" to warmer, earthier tones that feel more "homegrown."
    4. **Storytelling Flow**: The homepage acts as a narrative journey from "Problem" (Debt) to "Solution" (The Act/Counsellors).
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    **"Protea & Earth"**: Deep charcoal for text, paired with warm terracottas, sun-faded yellows, and a vibrant Protea pink/red for accents. It feels warm, local, and energetic.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Split-Screen Hero**: Asymmetrical split screens where image and text interact.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Geometric Pattern Overlays**: Subtle triangular or diamond patterns (Ndebele-inspired) used as low-opacity background textures.
    2. **Organic Shapes**: Images masked in organic, pebble-like shapes rather than strict squares.
    3. **Warm Gradients**: Backgrounds that shift from warm orange to soft yellow.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Fluid Storytelling**: Parallax scrolling effects where elements move at different speeds.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Staggered Reveal**: Elements cascade in one after another.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Poppins + Merriweather**: Poppins (Geometric Sans) for modern headings; Merriweather (Serif) for body text to give it a slightly "editorial/newspaper" feel, adding credibility.
