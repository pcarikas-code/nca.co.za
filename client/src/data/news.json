    "content": "The latest DebtBusters Debt Index for the third quarter of 2025 paints a concerning picture of South African consumer health. The report indicates that consumers entering debt counselling are now spending, on average, 70 cents of every Rand they earn just to service their debt obligations.\n\nThis severe financial strain is driving a rapid expansion in the 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) sector. While BNPL offers short-term liquidity, experts warn that it can easily lead to a debt spiral if not managed carefully. The National Credit Regulator is closely monitoring this sector to ensuring that these products do not bypass the affordability assessment requirements of the National Credit Act.",

    "content": "On 3 December 2025, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) confirmed that the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR) will be discontinued. JIBAR has long been the benchmark interest rate used for determining the cost of borrowing in South Africa, influencing everything from corporate loans to home mortgages.\n\nThe transition to a new reference rate is expected to modernize the financial system and align South Africa with global standards. However, consumers and businesses with variable-rate loans linked to JIBAR should prepare for potential adjustments in how their interest is calculated in the coming months.",

    "content": "The Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition has officially withdrawn the draft regulations that proposed listing educational institutions as credit providers under the National Credit Act (NCA). This decision comes after significant pushback from the banking sector and educational bodies, who argued that such a classification would severely hamper student access to finance.\n\nThe withdrawal notice was published in the Government Gazette, effectively nullifying the previous proposal. Industry experts have welcomed the move, stating that it allows for a more nuanced approach to student debt that doesn't inadvertently cut off funding avenues for those seeking higher education.\n\nMoving forward, the Department has indicated it will engage in further consultations to find a balanced regulatory framework that protects consumers without stifling the education sector.",

If a consumer feels their application was rejected based on discriminatory reasons rather than financial affordability, they have the right to lodge a complaint with the National Credit Regulator.",
