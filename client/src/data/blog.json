Here are five tips to help you manage your debt effectively in 2025:\n\n1. **Create a Budget:** The first step to financial freedom is knowing where your money goes. Track your income and expenses to identify areas where you can cut back.\n2. **Prioritize High-Interest Debt:** Focus on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first. This strategy, known as the avalanche method, saves you money in the long run.\n3. **Consolidate Your Debt:** If you have multiple debts, consider consolidating them into a single loan with a lower interest rate. This simplifies your payments and can reduce your monthly obligations.\n4. **Build an Emergency Fund:** Unexpected expenses can derail your debt repayment plan. Aim to save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund.\n5. **Seek Professional Help:** If you're struggling to make ends meet, don't hesitate to seek help from a registered debt counsellor.

    "content": "Your credit score is more than just a number; it's a reflection of your financial reliability. Lenders use it to determine whether to approve your loan applications and what interest rate to charge you.\n\n**What is a Credit Score?**\nA credit score is a three-digit number that predicts how likely you are to repay a loan on time. Scores typically range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better creditworthiness.\n\n**How is it Calculated?**\nSeveral factors influence your credit score, including:\n- **Payment History:** Do you pay your bills on time?\n- **Credit Utilization:** How much of your available credit are you using?\n- **Length of Credit History:** How long have you had credit accounts?\n- **New Credit:** Have you opened several new accounts recently?\n- **Credit Mix:** Do you have a mix of credit types, such as credit cards, installment loans, and mortgages?\n\n**How to Improve Your Score**\nImproving your credit score takes time, but it's possible. Start by paying your bills on time, reducing your debt, and avoiding opening too many new accounts at once.",

    "excerpt": "Wondering how long you'll be under debt review? We break down the timeline, from application to the clearance certificate.",
    "content": "One of the most common questions we receive is: *'How long will I be under debt review?'* The short answer is typically **36 to 60 months (3 to 5 years)**, but the reality depends on your specific financial situation. Let's break down the timeline step-by-step.\n\n### Phase 1: Application & Assessment (Weeks 1-2)\nThe process begins when you contact a [registered debt counsellor](/debt-counsellors). You'll submit Form 16 and provide details about your income, expenses, and debts. The counsellor will then notify your creditors and the credit bureaus that you have applied for debt review. This immediately flags your credit profile, preventing you from taking out further credit.\n\n### Phase 2: Negotiation & Court Order (Months 1-3)\nYour debt counsellor will calculate a new, affordable repayment plan and negotiate with your creditors. Once accepted, this plan is made an order of the court or the National Consumer Tribunal. This legal step is crucial as it formalizes the agreement and protects your assets from repossession. Learn more about your rights in [The National Credit Act](/the-act).\n\n### Phase 3: Repayment (Months 4-60)\nThis is the longest phase. You will make a single monthly payment to a Payment Distribution Agency (PDA), which then distributes the funds to your creditors. During this time, you must stick to the plan. If your financial situation improves, you can increase your payments to finish sooner.\n\n### Phase 4: Clearance Certificate (The Finish Line)\nOnce all your short-term debts are paid in full (and your bond payments are up to date), your debt counsellor will issue a **Clearance Certificate (Form 19)**. This certificate is sent to all credit bureaus, who must then remove the 'debt review' flag from your profile within 7 days. You are now debt-free and can re-enter the credit market with a clean slate.",

    "excerpt": "Confused between debt review and debt consolidation? We compare the pros, cons, and eligibility criteria to help you choose.",
    "content": "When you're drowning in debt, the terminology can be confusing. Two of the most popular solutions in South Africa are **Debt Review** and **Debt Consolidation**. While both aim to simplify your payments, they work in very different ways.\n\n### What is Debt Consolidation?\nDebt consolidation involves taking out a **new, large loan** to pay off all your smaller debts (credit cards, store accounts, etc.).\n\n**Pros:**\n- You only have one creditor to pay.\n- It simplifies your finances.\n- You are not flagged at the credit bureau (unless you default).\n\n**Cons:**\n- You need a good credit score to qualify.\n- You might end up paying more interest over a longer term.\n- It doesn't protect your assets legally.\n\n### What is Debt Review?\nDebt review is a **legal process** where a [debt counsellor](/debt-counsellors) renegotiates your existing debts to lower your monthly installments and interest rates. This process is regulated by the [National Credit Act](/the-act).\n\n**Pros:**\n- Immediate legal protection for your assets (home, car).\n- No new loan required; it uses your existing income.\n- Interest rates are often significantly reduced.\n\n**Cons:**\n- You cannot take out new credit while under review.\n- Your credit profile is flagged until you complete the process.\n\n### The Verdict\nIf you have a good credit score and just want to simplify admin, **Debt Consolidation** might be best. However, if you are over-indebted, struggling to make ends meet, or facing asset repossession, **Debt Review** is the safer, legally protected route.",
